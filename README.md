Based on this tutorial:

https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-code-a-fun-to-do-list-with-php-and-ajax--net-3170

If you're new to php/css/mysql/js then the above is a good intro if you have done some programming.

I can't find mention of a license so contact Jeffrey Way through the above link if you need clarification/

My changes/additions are GPL3

* Changed CSS to make it work better on my phone (still needs some work)
* No longer deletes entries from the table but marks them as complete 
(it was too easy to permanently delete an entry from my phone)
* added a simple php script to upgrade database
